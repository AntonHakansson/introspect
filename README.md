# introspect
A very simple c++ introspection system. 
In simple terms, a header file `generated.h` is generated for any struct that is annotated with `INTROSPECT`.
The generated header file contains the type information for the annotated structs.

## Build
Before running `build.bat` run `shell/setVcArgs.bat` to configure x64 build environment.
